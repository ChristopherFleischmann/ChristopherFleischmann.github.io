Over the summer I interned at Nclud, a web design company. While I was there I learned a variety of new skills such as: HTML and CSS programming, Data Entry, and web design. I used these new skills to help with one of the major projects that they were working on, Carmel Partners, a national investment and development, real estate company. In the project I mostly dealt with the data entry and identifing code defects that dont produce the right visual appeal.
