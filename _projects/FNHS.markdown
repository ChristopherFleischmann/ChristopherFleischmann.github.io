At the start of my senior year my class in French 4 wanted to establish a French National Honor Society for our school. As a result we needed a website in order to host the calendar, public documents and media. My goal was to make a simplistic website that needed minimal maintainance and was easy to maintain if need be. The result was a website that was hosted by GitHub Pages and had a custom URL. I design the wesite to basically be self maintained by having posts and hour opportunites be a feed from social media.
