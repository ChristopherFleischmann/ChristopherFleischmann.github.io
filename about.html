    <p class="c-page__text"> My name is Christopher Fleischmann, I am 17 years old and I love computer science. My first introduction to computer science was during the summer between my freshman and sophomore year in high school. I attended a two-week camp at UT Austin that introduced me to the Java programming language.  It was very intensive and I didnâ€™t understand a lot of the material at the time. However, that did not deter me and I kept on following the path of programming. When I started my sophomore year, I signed up for a computer science class and I joined a club that allowed me to put my computer science skills to practice.</p>
